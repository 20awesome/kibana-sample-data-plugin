Kibana 6.4 added sample data sets as a one click way to populate elasticsearch with data and set up Kibana with Searches, Visualizatoins, and Dashboards.

This plugin is just a demo showing how you could add your own custom sample data sets.

This plugin will not be maintained or kept up to date with future Kibana changes
